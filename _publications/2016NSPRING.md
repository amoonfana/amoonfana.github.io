Mining sequences and patterns in time series data streams is fast becoming a common practice in todayâ€™s world. The rapid progress of data collection and web technologies yields tremendous growth of flowing data in various complex forms that need to be analyzed in real time. Traditional data mining methods that typically require the process data to be scanned repeatedly are not feasible for stream data applications. However, new techniques like SPRING attempt to address these challenges by identifying sequences of patterns on time series streams, thus reducing the complexity to be linear in both time and space. Unfortunately, SPRING does not support data normalization, which renders it to be not applicable for most data sets. In this paper, we are proposing an approach called NSPRING based on SPRING that extends the advantages of SPRING, e.g., low in time and space complexity, while it can support normalization. Furthermore, NSPRING retains similar mining accuracy to SPRING.
